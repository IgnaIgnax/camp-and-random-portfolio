#Comparison between CAPM and Random Stock Portfolio

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is one of the fundamental theories in financial investment evaluation, providing a rigorous methodology to estimate the expected return of a financial asset based on its risk. However, the practical application of the CAPM has often raised questions and debates regarding its ability to accurately predict the actual returns on investments in a real-world context.

Through an empirical approach, we intend to examine whether the CAPM can effectively identify financial assets that provide higher returns compared to a randomly constructed portfolio.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) formula provides a methodology for determining the expected return of a financial asset based on its risk. The CAPM formula is expressed as follows:
E(Ri)=Rf+βi(E(Rm)−Rf)

Where:

• E(Ri) is the expected return of financial asset i,

• Rf is the risk-free rate of return (such as the return on a government bond),

• βi is the beta coefficient of financial asset i, measuring its sensitivity to market movements,

• E(Rm) is the expected return of the market, and

• (E(Rm)−Rf) represents the market risk premium, i.e., the additional return investors require for bearing market risk.

In summary, the CAPM formula relates the expected return of a financial asset to the expected return of the market and the market risk premium, adjusting this relationship based on the asset's sensitivity to market movements, represented by the beta coefficient. This model is widely used in finance to evaluate the expected return of an investment and determine if that return is adequate given the risk assumed.
